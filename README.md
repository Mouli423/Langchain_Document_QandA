# Langchain_Document_QandA
## Document Q&A System (RAG-based)

- This project is an AI-powered Question-Answering (Q&A) web app that answers questions based on research papers using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
It combines the power of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), LangChain, and Streamlit to deliver context-aware, explainable responses from uploaded documents.

### Features

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) — integrates document retrieval and generation.

- Transformer Architecture — inspired by the paper “Attention Is All You Need”.

- LLM Model — powered by LLaMA 3.1 through Groq API.

- Vector Database — efficient document retrieval using FAISS.

- Embeddings — built using HuggingFace all-MiniLM-L6-v2.

- Framework — implemented with LangChain and Streamlit.

- Interactive UI — users can view available research papers, create embeddings, and ask questions seamlessly.
